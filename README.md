## Overview
Surface crack Classification Model is an image classification project aimed at accurately identifying crack of surface or other things like eggs from input images. Leveraging deep learning techniques, this project uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to distinguish.

## Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arunrk7/surface-crack-detection/download?datasetVersionNumber=1
At first I download and then use train-test-split to all the paths and put each to train,val, test folders.

## Creating Model
Explain the process of creating the model. This section can include:
- Data preprocessing
- Model architecture design (e.g., neural network layers)
- Training process and tuning parameters
- Best Models saving on final training
- Testing with test dataset and put accuracy. After that test with just one image 

## Loading the Model into TensorFlow Lite
Describe the steps involved in converting the model to TensorFlow Lite format. Include:
- Necessary libraries or tools required for conversion
- Conversion process from the trained model to TensorFlow Lite (using keras-image-helper) 
- Testing

You can give me 0 point for cloud computing. I don't have much time left before deadline. So I skipped deploying to the cloud.
