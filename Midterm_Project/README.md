## Overview

This project focuses on using machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on a given dataset. It uses machine learning techniques to analyze various features and provide predictions for early detection of heart disease. The project aims to assist medical professionals in diagnosing patients more accurately and quickly.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the heart_statlog_cleveland_hungary_final.csv. This dataset contains various clinical and demographic features that are useful for predicting heart disease.

## Project Description

- The project includes the following components:
  - Data preprocessing and cleaning
  - Feature selection and engineering
  - Building, training, and evaluating machine learning models
  - Developing a web application for heart disease prediction
  - Deployment to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk)

## Model Training

 From the dataset, after traing Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGB boosting, Random Forest model give the best results.

## How to Run

 There is docker file, also pipfile and pipfile.lock so you just need to run these file.
